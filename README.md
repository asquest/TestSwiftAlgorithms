## About App

The TestSwiftUIAlgorithms workspace is a collection of algorithms written in Swift

## Features

1) Fibonaaci Number: Implemented using iterative approach with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1). Also added a matrix exponentiation method to calculate Fibonacci number which takes O(log n) time and space complexity of O(1)

2) Palindrome Checker: Implemented using iterative approach using Stack and Sequence protocol with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n). Used Generics to support multiple data types. Used natural language to tokenize a string for units like word and and return output as a dictionary of word and boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome word or not.

3) Anagrams: Implemeted Anagrams from a word with time adn space complexity O(n!) using heap algorithms. Implemented a function to check if one word is anagram to another. Implemented a func to group anagrams in a sentence.

4) String reverser: Implemented String reverser algorithm with time complexity O(log n) and Space complexity of O(1). Special characters remain at their same positions.
