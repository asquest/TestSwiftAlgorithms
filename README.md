# Test Swift Algorithms

## Version

1.0

## Build and Runtime Requirements
+ Xcode 11.0 or later
+ iOS or MacOS

## Frameworks Used
+ Foundation

## About App

The TestSwiftUIAlgorithms workspace is a collection of algorithms written in Swift

## Features

1) Fibonaaci Series: Implemented using iterative approach with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1). Also added a matrix exponentiation method to calculate Fibonacci series Would take O(log n) time and space complexity of O(1)

2) Palindrome Checker: Implemented using iterative approach using Stack and Sequence protocol with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n). Used Generics to support multiple data types. Used natural language to tokenize a string for units like word and and return output as a dictionary of word and boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome word or not.
