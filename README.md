# Test Swift Algorithms

## Version

1.0

## Build and Runtime Requirements
+ Xcode 11.0 or later
+ iOS or MacOS

## Frameworks Used
+ Foundation

## About App

The TestSwiftUIAlgorithms workspace is a collection of algorithms written in Swift

## Features

1) Fibonaaci Series: Implemented using iterative approach with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1)

2) Palindrome Checker: Implemented using iterative approach using Stack and Sequence protocol with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n). Used Generics to support multiple data types.
